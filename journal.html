            <h3>1) How did you approach mobile-first design?</h3>
            <p>
              I started with a simple one-column layout, larger tap targets, and comfortable
              line length for text on small screens. Once the mobile view felt readable and
              usable, I added a media query to introduce multi-column layouts on wider screens.

          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>2) Most useful HTML/CSS concept?</h3>
            <p>
              Flexbox and CSS Grid were the most useful because they gave me precise control
              over layout without relying on hacks. I also used CSS variables for colours and spacing
              so I could keep the visual style consistent across pages.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>3) Most challenging?</h3>
            <p>
              The hardest part was keeping the design consistent as I created more pages. It was
              easy to accidentally introduce slightly different font sizes or spacings, so I had to
              keep refactoring the CSS to stay organised and accessible.

        <h2>Week 2 — Structuring the Learning Journal PWA</h2>

            <h3>1) What did you focus on this week?</h3>
            <p>
              I focused on building the core structure for my Learning Journal PWA: creating the
              main pages (Home, Journal, Projects, About), setting up a consistent header and
              footer, and refining the layout using my dark theme design.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>2) What went well?</h3>
            <p>
              Setting up the folder structure and linking assets worked smoothly. I also felt more
              confident about responsive design and was able to reuse the same patterns across
              multiple pages without rewriting everything.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>3) What would you improve?</h3>
            <p>
              I would like to spend more time on typography and spacing to make the journal feel
              more like a polished product. I also want to plan the content of each page earlier
              instead of just styling placeholder text.

      <!-- Week 3 entry: JavaScript & DOM Manipulation -->
      <article class="entry">
        <h2>Week 3 — JavaScript & DOM Manipulation</h2>
        <time datetime="2025-11-12" class="muted">12 Nov 2025</time>
        <ol class="qa">
          <li>
            <h3>1) Which DOM selection methods did you use, and why did you choose them?</h3>
            <p>
              I used several DOM selection methods this week:
              <strong>getElementById()</strong> to grab unique elements like
              <code>#site-header</code>, <code>#current-date</code>, and <code>#year</code>,
              because it is simple and fast for single elements.
              I used <strong>querySelector()</strong> to access elements inside the injected
              navigation, such as the menu toggle button and the theme toggle.
              Finally, I used <strong>querySelectorAll()</strong> to loop through all navigation
              links so I could set the <code>aria-current</code> attribute based on the current
              page. These methods together gave me flexibility to control both structure and
              behaviour across multiple pages.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>2) What was the most challenging part about linking JavaScript with your HTML?</h3>
            <p>
              The most challenging part was replacing the static navigation markup on each page
              with a reusable template generated by JavaScript. At first, I had both the old HTML
              nav and the new JS-generated nav on the page, which caused visual duplication and
              layout issues. I also ran into a problem where the CSS file path and the expected
              classes did not line up with the new structure, so the header briefly lost its
              styling. I fixed this by carefully checking file paths, removing the old nav
              markup, and making sure the injected template matched the existing CSS classes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>3) How did you test and debug your JavaScript code?</h3>
            <p>
              I used the browser developer tools to test my changes. The JavaScript console helped
              me catch errors quickly, and I used <code>console.log()</code> to check that elements
              were being selected correctly and that event listeners were attached.
              I also did hard refreshes to make sure the browser was loading the latest version of my
              scripts. Finally, I clicked through all pages (Home, Journal, Projects, About) to test
              that the reusable navigation, theme switcher, and dynamic date worked consistently.
